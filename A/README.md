# A: Standard Utilities

The A-drive contains some "standard" utilities that you might expect to find on a CP/M system:

* DUMP.COM
  * Dump file contents - this is enhanced to show both HEX and ASCII contents of files.
  * Written using the Aztec C-compiler, you can find in [C:](../C/), along with source code.
* S.COM
  * A simple vi-like editor, source code can be found in [this repository](https://github.com/udo-munk/s/).
* STAT.COM
  * Show file details; note that currently file-sizes are not correct.
