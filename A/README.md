# A: Standard Utilities

The A-drive contains some "standard" utilities that you might expect to find on a CP/M system:

* DUMP.COM
  * Dump file contents - this is enhanced to show both HEX and ASCII contents of files.
  * Written using the Aztec C-compiler, you can find in [C:](../C/), along with source code.
